Startup Apps Runner

This tool can be used to have a single point where we can specify all the required startup-apps to spawn up.

Some examples for why we need this is, as we can be having different set of apps for different mode of work. So we can have a set of apps for work mode and when we are actually working, we could just run this so that all apps are set and open.
